# Devvit MCP Server Integration

This project is configured to use the **Devvit Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server. This allows AI agents to directly search the official Reddit Developer documentation and access application logs for context-aware assistance.

## Available Tools

The Devvit MCP server provides the following tools for the agent:

### 1. `devvit_search`
**Purpose:** Search the official Reddit Developer documentation.
**Usage:** Use this when you need authoritative information about the Devvit API, platform capabilities, limitations, or examples.
**Example:** `devvit_search(query: "how to use redis in devvit")`
**Best Practice:** Prefer using this tool over relying on general training data, as the Devvit platform evolves rapidly.

### 2. `devvit_logs` (Experimental)
**Purpose:** Query logs for a deployed Devvit application on a specific subreddit.
**Usage:** Use this to debug runtime issues or understand current app behavior in a live environment.
**Example:** `devvit_logs(subreddit: "my_subreddit", timeframe: "1h")` (Check actual tool signature for precise arguments).

## Configuration

To ensure this MCP server is active in your AI editor (Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code), verify the following configuration in your MCP settings (e.g., `.cursor/mcp.json` or equivalent):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devvit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@devvit/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration Workflow

1. **Problem Identification:** When faced with a Devvit-specific question or error.
2. **Search:** Use `devvit_search` to find relevant documentation.
3. **Plan:** Formulate a solution based on the retrieved docs.
4. **Implement:** Write code that aligns with the official API patterns.
5. **Debug (if needed):** Use `devvit_logs` to investigate runtime behavior if the app is deployed.

## LLM Context Files
